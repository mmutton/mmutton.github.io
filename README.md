# Project Name: Arctic
 
  * Description: Arctic is a whimsical single page site that explores life at the North 	
		Pole.

		A beautiful background image and soft text colors greets the visitor, and a fun "why" button is irresistible.

 		Dropdown menu links to web sources which pertain to life in the Arctic, including a conservation site, NASA's take on climate change in the Arctic region, and Unsplash.com for more beautiful images.

		This project was created just for fun, but includes some interesting content and pretty pictures.
