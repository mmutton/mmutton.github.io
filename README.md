## The Arctic project: 
A small educational site about the Arctic.

Three dropdown menu items reveal links to resources pertaining to life in the Arctic region. These include a conservation site, the image sharing site Unsplash.com, for a look at additional arctic images, and finally NASA's take on climate change.

This project was created just for fun, but includes some interesting content, pretty pictures and a cool "why" button.
