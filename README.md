## Project Name: Arctic
 
### Description: 
Arctic is a whimsical single page site that explores life at the North Pole.

In addition to a beautiful background image and soft text colors, Arctic includes a fun "why" button which takes the visitor to the reason for Fox's warm coat.

Three dropdown menu items reveal links to web sources pertaining to life in the Arctic region, including a conservation site, NASA's take on climate change, and Unsplash.com for a look at additional beautiful images.

This project was created just for fun, but includes some interesting content and pretty pictures.
